# Robotic's Notebook (Luca DalCanto)

Check out the team's [Github Repo](https://github.com/Luca-Skyline/Ctrl-Alt-Defeat) for the collaboration database for our robot.



## Idea for Object Manipulator (in development)

## Current Math for Drivetrain Movement
The goal of this math is to allow the robot to move straight in any global direction while also rotating (changing heading). We will be accomplishing this with 2 controllers, and the math to accomplish this is still in development. 
For instance, we hope to have one controller give the instruction to drive North, and the robot will move in a straight line to the North as the second controller tells it to spin counterclockwise. This will increase efficiency and speed as the robot moves theoughout the stage.
